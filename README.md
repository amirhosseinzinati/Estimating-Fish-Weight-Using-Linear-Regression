# Estimating-Fish-Weight-Using-Linear-Regression
This project explores the relationship between various measurements of fish and their weight, with the goal of building a linear regression model to accurately estimate the weight of a fish based on its measurements. The dataset used for this project includes measurements of several fish species, including their length, height, width, and weight.

To build the model, we first performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of the data and identify any outliers or missing values. We then used feature engineering techniques to select the most relevant features and transform them into a format suitable for regression analysis. Finally, we trained and evaluated several linear regression models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.

The resulting model achieved an R2 Score of  0.988, indicating that it performs well at estimating fish weights based on their measurements. This project demonstrates the power of linear regression for predicting continuous outcomes and provides insight into the factors that influence fish weight.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found at [Fish Market](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/fish-market). It includes measurements of several fish species, including their length, height, width, and weight. The data is provided in a CSV format and is ready for analysis in Python or other data analysis tools.
